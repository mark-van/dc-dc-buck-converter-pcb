## DC to DC Buck Converter

PCB desinged to efficiently step down voltage from 30-40V to 5V with a maximum output current of 5A. 

For a 3D view please open this [3DPDF](https://github.com/mark-van/dc-dc-buck-converter-pcb/blob/main/Project%20Outputs%20for%20DC-to-DC-converter/PDF3D/no%20components%20fitted.PDF) with appropriate software (like Adobe Reader)

Also completed a PCB using using the TO-263 package which is more compact but will likely suffer a greater temperature rise: 3DPDF
