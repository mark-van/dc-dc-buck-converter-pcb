# DC to DC Buck Converter

I designed this PCB to efficiently step down voltage from 30-40V to 5V with a maximum output current of 5A. Design is also easily adaptable for use with other voltage outputs. 

## Who will use it

Created for UBC Thunderbikes for use in their electric motorcycle build. Will step down voltages from the peripheral battery for use with the onboard raspberry pi and other components.

Also completed a PCB using using the TO-263 package which is more compact but will likely suffer a greater temperature rise: [3DPDF](https://github.com/mark-van/dc-dc-buck-converter-pcb/blob/main/Project%20Outputs%20for%20DC-to-DC-converter/PDF3D/no%20components%20fitted%20TO-263.PDF)
